## **Python Basics: Your First Steps**

**Let's dive into the world of Python\!** In this simple example, we'll learn how to store numbers, perform a basic calculation, and display the result.

### **Storing Numbers**

First, we'll create two variables: `number1` and `number2`. Think of variables as containers that hold values. We assign the values `5` and `3` to these variables, respectively.

Python  
number1 \= 5  
number2 \= 3

 .

### **Performing a Calculation**

Now, let's add the values stored in `number1` and `number2`. We'll store the result in a new variable called `result`.

Python  
result \= number1 \+ number2

 .

### **Displaying the Result**

Finally, we'll use the `print` function to display the value of `result`.

Python  
print("The result is:", result)

 .

**Putting it all together:**

Python  
number1 \= 5  
number2 \= 3  
result \= number1 \+ number2  
print("The result is:", result)

 .

**This will output:**

The result is: 8

**Python Programming: Your First Steps**

**Welcome to the world of Python\!** This easy-to-learn programming language is used by millions worldwide. In this lesson, we'll cover the basics to get you started.

### **What is Programming?**

Imagine you're giving a robot instructions. You need to be very specific and clear. That's essentially what programming is: writing instructions (or code) for a computer to follow.

### **Your First Python Program**

Let's start with a classic: the "Hello, World\!" program. This simple program prints a message to the screen.

Python  
print("Hello, World\!")

 .

### **Basic Building Blocks**

* **Syntax:** It's like grammar for computers. Pay attention to spacing, capitalization, and punctuation.  
* **Arithmetic:** You can perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
* **Variables:** Think of them as containers that store information. For example:

Python  
name \= "Alice"  
age \= 30

 .

### **Making Decisions**

* **Conditional Statements:** Use `if` statements to make decisions based on conditions.

Python  
if age \>= 18:  
    print("You are an adult.")  
else:  
    print("You are a minor.")

 .

### **Repeating Tasks**

* **Loops:** Use `for` loops to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Python  
for i in range(5):  
    print("Hello\!")

 .

### **Getting Input**

* **User Input:** Use the `input()` function to get information from the user.

Python  
name \= input("What is your name? ")  
print("Hello, " \+ name \+ "\!")

## **Conditional Calculations: Making Smart Decisions in Python**

**Imagine your code as a detective.** It needs to gather evidence (data), analyze it (perform calculations), and then make informed decisions (use conditions). That's where combining tests and calculations comes into play.

**Let's break it down with a simple example:**

Python  
number \= int(input("Enter a number: "))  
if number % 2 \== 0:  
    print("The number is even.")  
else:  
    print("The number is odd.")

 .

1. **Gather Evidence:** We ask the user for a number.  
2. **Analyze the Data:** We use the modulus operator (`%`) to check if the number has a remainder when divided by 2\.  
3. **Make a Decision:** If there's no remainder, the number is even. Otherwise, it's odd.

**Another scenario:**

Python  
score \= int(input("Enter your score: "))  
if score \>= 50:  
    print("You passed the exam\!")  
else:  
    print("You failed the exam. Better luck next time\!")

 .

Here, we calculate a passing grade (50) and compare it to the user's score. Based on the comparison, we decide whether the student passed or failed.

**By combining calculations and conditions, your Python code can:**

* **Automate decision-making:** No more manual checks\!  
* **Create dynamic programs:** Adapt to different inputs and situations.  
* **Solve complex problems:** Tackle tasks that require logical reasoning.

**So, the next time you're faced with a programming challenge, remember:** **Think, calculate, decide.**

**Understanding Variables in Python: A Quick Guide**

**Imagine variables as little boxes.** You can put different things (numbers, words, or even more complex data) inside them. These boxes have names so you can easily find and use the information they store.

### **Creating Variables**

To make a box (or variable), you give it a name and put something inside it.

Python  
age \= 25  
name \= "Alice"

 .

### **Naming Rules**

* **No spaces:** Use underscores (`_`) to separate words.  
* **Start with a letter or underscore:** Avoid starting with numbers.  
* **Case matters:** `age` and `Age` are different.

### **Types of Things**

You can put different kinds of things in your boxes:

* **Numbers:** `10` (integer), `3.14` (float)  
* **Words:** `"Hello"` (string)

### **Changing the Contents**

You can change what's inside a box later.

Python  
age \= 25  
age \= 30

 .

### **Using Variables**

You can use variables in calculations and to print messages.

Python  
x \= 5  
y \= 10  
result \= x \+ y  
print("The result is:", result)

 .

**Remember:** Variables are like your tools. Use them wisely to build your Python programs\!

Sure\! Here's a brief overview on building prompts for large language models (LLMs) and how you might use them in functions:

\---

## \*\*Building Prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs)\*\*

Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-3 are powerful tools for generating human-like text based on the input (or \*prompt\*) they receive. Crafting effective prompts is key to getting useful and relevant responses from these models.

\#\#\# Key Points for Building Effective Prompts:

1\. \*\*Clarity and Specificity:\*\*  
   \- Be as clear and specific as possible in your prompt to guide the LLM towards the desired response.  
   \- Example:  
     \`\`\`text  
     "Translate the following English sentence to French: 'Hello, how are you?'"  
     \`\`\`

2\. \*\*Context:\*\*  
   \- Providing context can help the LLM understand the scenario better.  
   \- Example:  
     \`\`\`text  
     "You are a helpful assistant. Explain the concept of gravity in simple terms."  
     \`\`\`

3\. \*\*Direct Questions and Instructions:\*\*  
   \- Directly ask questions or give clear instructions to guide the LLM.  
   \- Example:  
     \`\`\`text  
     "List five benefits of regular exercise."  
     \`\`\`

4\. \*\*Examples:\*\*  
   \- Providing examples can help the LLM understand the format and type of response you are expecting.  
   \- Example:  
     \`\`\`text  
     "Complete the following table with appropriate adjectives:  
     | Object | Adjective |  
     | Car | Fast |  
     | House | "  
     \`\`\`

## Using LLM Prompts in Python Functions

Incorporating Large Language Model (LLM) prompts within Python functions can be a powerful way to automate tasks that involve generating text, answering questions, or providing summaries. By leveraging LLMs, you can enhance the functionality of your Python scripts and streamline various workflows.

\#\#\#\# Importing the Necessary Functions

To get started, you'll need to import some helper functions that allow you to interact with the LLM:

\`\`\`python  
from helper\_functions import print\_llm\_response, get\_llm\_response  
\`\`\`

These functions enable you to send prompts to an LLM and handle the responses efficiently. For example, you might use \`get\_llm\_response\` to fetch a response based on a prompt and \`print\_llm\_response\` to display it.

\#\#\#\# Understanding Dictionaries in Python

Before diving into LLM prompts, it's essential to understand the data structures you'll work with. In Python, dictionaries are a common and powerful tool. Unlike lists, which use numerical indexes to store values, dictionaries assign keys to each value. This key-value pairing is akin to how words are paired with their definitions in a traditional dictionary.

Consider the following list of ice cream flavors:

\`\`\`python  
ice\_cream\_flavors \= \[  
    "Vanilla: Classic and creamy with a rich, smooth flavor from real vanilla beans.",  
    "Chocolate: Deep and indulgent, made with rich cocoa for a satisfying chocolate experience.",  
    "Strawberry: Sweet and fruity, bursting with the fresh taste of ripe strawberries.",  
    "Mint Chocolate Chip: Refreshing mint ice cream studded with decadent chocolate chips.",  
    "Cookie Dough: Vanilla ice cream loaded with chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough.",  
    "Salted Caramel: Sweet and salty with a smooth caramel swirl and a hint of sea salt.",  
    "Pistachio: Nutty and creamy, featuring the distinct taste of real pistachios.",  
    "Cookies and Cream: Vanilla ice cream packed with chunks of chocolate sandwich cookies.",  
    "Mango: Tropical and tangy, made with juicy mangoes for a refreshing treat.",  
    "Rocky Road: Chocolate ice cream mixed with marshmallows, nuts, and chocolate chunks."  
\]  
\`\`\`

While this list is straightforward, accessing a specific flavor's description requires knowing its index. A more efficient approach might involve using a dictionary:

\`\`\`python  
ice\_cream\_flavors \= {  
   "Mint Chocolate Chip": "Refreshing mint ice cream studded with decadent chocolate chips.",  
   "Cookie Dough": "Vanilla ice cream loaded with chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough.",  
   "Salted Caramel": "Sweet and salty with a smooth caramel swirl and a hint of sea salt."  
}  
\`\`\`

Here, each flavor is a key, and its description is the corresponding value. You can easily access the description of a flavor by using its key.

\#\#\#\# Accessing Elements in a Dictionary

To see the keys and values in your dictionary, you can use the following commands:

\`\`\`python  
print(ice\_cream\_flavors.keys())   \# Prints the keys  
print(ice\_cream\_flavors.values()) \# Prints the values  
\`\`\`

Attempting to access elements in a dictionary using list indexing will result in an error:

\`\`\`python  
\# Wrong way of accessing elements (treating dict as a list)  
print(ice\_cream\_flavors\[0\])  
\`\`\`

Instead, to access the value associated with a specific key, use the key itself:

\`\`\`python  
cookie\_dough\_description \= ice\_cream\_flavors\["Cookie Dough"\]  
print(cookie\_dough\_description)  
\`\`\`

This approach ensures that you retrieve the correct value without any ambiguity.

## **Level Up Your Python Skills: Mastering Dictionaries**

**Dictionaries: Your Key to Organized Data**

Think of dictionaries as digital filing cabinets, where each key is like a file folder and its corresponding value is the information inside. In Python, dictionaries are incredibly versatile tools for storing and accessing data in a structured way.

**Adding and Updating: Building Your Dictionary**

To add a new item to a dictionary, simply assign a value to a new key. It's like adding a new file folder to your cabinet. For example:

Python  
my\_dictionary \= {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}  
my\_dictionary\["city"\] \= "New York"

 

Now, `my_dictionary` contains three key-value pairs.

To update an existing value, you just need to assign a new value to the same key:

Python  
my\_dictionary\["age"\] \= 31

**Nesting Structures: Organizing Complex Data**

Dictionaries can also contain other dictionaries or lists, creating nested structures. This is especially useful for representing complex relationships between data:

Python  
person \= {  
    "name": "Bob",  
    "hobbies": \["reading", "hiking", "cooking"\],  
    "address": {  
        "street": "123 Main St",  
        "city": "Anytown"  
    }  
}

**Real-World Application: Prioritizing Tasks**

Let's say you have a list of tasks and want to prioritize them. You can use a dictionary to group tasks by priority:

Python  
tasks \= {  
    "high\_priority": \["Finish project report", "Attend important meeting"\],  
    "medium\_priority": \["Respond to emails", "Schedule appointments"\],  
    "low\_priority": \["Clean desk", "Watch a movie"\]  
}

## **Unleashing the Power of Dictionaries for LLM Prompts**

**Imagine this:** You have a vast encyclopedia of animals stored in a Python dictionary. Each entry contains detailed information like size, habitat, and diet. How can you harness this knowledge to create engaging prompts for a language model (LLM)?

**Let's dive into an example:**

Python  
animal\_info \= {  
    'elephant': {'size': 'large', 'habitat': 'savannah', 'diet': 'herbivore'},  
    'eagle': {'size': 'medium', 'habitat': 'mountains', 'diet': 'carnivore'},  
    'shark': {'size': 'large', 'habitat': 'ocean', 'diet': 'carnivore'}  
}

**Creating Prompts One by One:**

For a specific animal, like the elephant:

Python  
elephant\_info \= animal\_info\['elephant'\]  
elephant\_prompt \= f"Tell me about a {elephant\_info\['size'\]} animal that lives in the {elephant\_info\['habitat'\]} and has a {elephant\_info\['diet'\]} diet."  
print(elephant\_prompt)

**Output:**

Tell me about a large animal that lives in the savannah and has a herbivore diet.

**Iterating Through the Dictionary:**

To generate prompts for all animals:

Python  
for animal, details in animal\_info.items():  
    prompt \= f"Tell me about a {details\['size'\]} animal that lives in the {details\['habitat'\]} and has a {details\['diet'\]} diet."  
    print(prompt)
